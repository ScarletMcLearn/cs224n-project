Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS
Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius; come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna,
trust not Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus loves thee not.
Et tu, Brutus?
Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved Rome more.
Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears.
For Brutus is an honourable man. So are they all, all honourable men.
In every wound of Caesar that should move The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
Let not a traitor live!
