rest from their functions  they put forth to steal  there s not a soldier of us all  that  in the thanksgiving before meat  do relish the petition well that prays for peace  second gentleman never

language  first gentleman think  or in any religion  ay  why not  grace is grace  despite of all controversy  as  for example  thou thyself art a wicked villain  despite of all grace  first gentleman well  there went but a pair of shears between us  grant  as there may between the lists and the velvet  thou art the list  first gentleman and thou the velvet  thou art good velvet  thou rt a three

 and he was ever precise in promise keeping  second gentleman besides  you know  it draws something near to the speech we had to such a purpose  first gentleman but  most of all  agreeing with the proclamation  away  let s go learn the truth of it  exeunt and gentlemen thus  what with the war  what with the sweat  what with the gallows and what with poverty  am custom shrunk  enter how now  what s the news with you  yonder man is carried to prison  well  what has he done  woman  but what s his offence  groping for trouts in a peculiar river  what  is there a maid with child by him  no

in the city  they shall stand for seed  they had gone down too  but that a wise burgher put in for them  but shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be pulled down  to the ground  mistress  why  here s a change indeed in the commonwealth  what shall become of me  come  fear you not  good counsellors lack no clients  though you change your place  you need not change your trade  i ll be your tapster still  courage  there will be pity taken on you  you that have worn your eyes almost out in the service  you will be considered  what s to do here  thomas tapster  let s withdraw  here comes signior claudio  led by the provost to prison  and there s madam juliet  exeunt enter provost  and officers fellow  why dost thou show me thus to the world  bear me to prison  where am committed  provost do it not in evil disposition  but from lord angelo by special charge  thus can the demigod authority make us pay down for our offence by weight the words of heaven  on whom it will  it will  on whom it will not  so  yet still  tis just  re enter and two gentlemen why  how now  claudio  whence comes this restraint  from too much liberty  my lucio  liberty  as surfeit is the father of much fast  so every scope by the immoderate use turns to restraint  our natures do pursue  like rats that ravin down their proper bane  thirsty evil  and when we drink we die  if could speak so wisely under an arrest  would send for certain of my creditors  and yet  to say the truth  had as lief have the foppery of freedom as the morality of imprisonment  what s thy offence  claudio  what but to speak of would offend again  what  is t murder  no  lechery  call it so  provost away  sir  you must go  one word  good friend  lucio  a word with you  hundred  if they ll do you any good  is lechery so look d after  thus stands it with me  upon a true contract got possession of julietta s bed  you know the lady  she is fast my wife  save that we do the denunciation lack of outward order  this we came not to  only for propagation of a dower remaining in the coffer of her friends  from whom we thought it meet to hide our love till time had made them for us  but it chances the stealth of our most mutual entertainment with character too gross is writ on juliet  with child  perhaps  unhappily  even so  and the new deputy now for the duke   whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness  or whether that the body public be horse whereon the governor doth ride  who  newly in the seat  that it may know he can command  lets it straight feel the spur  whether the tyranny be in his place  or in his emmence that fills it up  stagger in   but this new governor awakes me all the enrolled penalties which have  like unscour d armour  hung by the wall so long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round and none of them been worn  and  for a name  now puts the drowsy and neglected act freshly on me   tis surely for a name  warrant it is  and thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders that a milkmaid  if she be in love  may sigh it off  send after the duke and appeal to him  have done so  but he s not to be found  prithee  lucio  do me this kind service  this day my sister should the cloister enter and there receive her approbation  acquaint her with the danger of my state  implore her  in my voice  that she make friends to the strict deputy  bid herself assay him  have great hope in that  for in her youth there is a prone and speechless dialect  such as move men  beside  she hath prosperous art when she will play with reason and discourse  and well she can persuade  pray she may  as well for the encouragement of the like  which else would stand under grievous imposition  as for the enjoying of thy life  who would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a game of tick tack  i ll to her  thank you  good friend lucio  within two hours  come  officer  away  exeunt monastery  enter and no  holy father  throw away that thought  believe not that the dribbling dart of love can pierce a complete bosom  why desire thee to give me secret harbour  hath a purpose more grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends of burning youth  may your grace speak of it  my holy sir  none better knows than you how have ever loved the life removed and held in idle price to haunt assemblies where youth  and cost  and witless bravery keeps  have deliver d to lord angelo  man of stricture and firm abstinence  my absolute power and place here in vienna  and he supposes me travell d to poland  for so have strew d it in the common ear  and so it is received  now  pious sir  you will demand of me why do this  gladly  my lord  we have strict statutes and most biting laws  the needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds  which for this nineteen years we have let slip  even like an o ergrown lion in a cave  that goes not out to prey  now  as fond fathers  having bound up the threatening twigs of birch  only to stick it in their children s sight for terror  not to use  in time the rod becomes more mock d than fear d  so our decrees  dead to infliction  to themselves are dead  and liberty plucks justice by the nose  the baby beats the nurse  and quite athwart goes all decorum  it rested in your grace to unloose this tied up justice when you pleased  and it in you more dreadful would have seem d than in lord angelo  do fear  too dreadful  sith  twas my fault to give the people scope   twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them for what bid them do  for we bid this be done  when evil deeds have their permissive pass and not the punishment  therefore indeed  my father  have on angelo imposed the office  who may  in the ambush of my name  strike home  and yet my nature never in the fight to do in slander  and to behold his sway  will  as  twere a brother of your order  visit both prince and people  therefore  prithee  supply me with the habit and instruct me how may formally in person bear me like a true friar  more reasons for this action at our more leisure shall render you  only  this one  lord angelo is precise  stands at a guard with envy  scarce confesses that his blood flows  or that his appetite is more to bread than stone  hence shall we see  if power change purpose  what our seemers be  exeunt nunnery  enter and and have you nuns no farther privileges  are not these large enough  yes  truly  speak not as desiring more  but rather wishing a more strict restraint upon the sisterhood  the votarists of saint clare  within ho  peace be in this place  who s that which calls  it is a man s voice  gentle isabella  turn you the key  and know his business of him  you may  may not  you are yet unsworn  when you have vow d  you must not speak with men but in the presence of the prioress  then  if you speak  you must not show your face  or  if you show your face  you must not speak  he calls again  pray you  answer him  exit peace and prosperity  who is t that calls enter hail  virgin  if you be  as those cheek roses proclaim you are no less  can you so stead me as bring me to the sight of isabella  novice of this place and the fair sister to her unhappy brother claudio  why  her unhappy brother   let me ask  the rather for now must make you know am that isabella and his sister  gentle and fair  your brother kindly greets you  not to be weary with you  he s in prison  woe me  for what  for that which  if myself might be his judge  he should receive his punishment in thanks  he hath got his friend with child  sir  make me not your story  it is true  would not  though  tis my familiar sin with maids to seem the lapwing and to jest  tongue far from heart  play with all virgins so  hold you as a thing ensky d and sainted  by your renouncement an immortal spirit  and to be talk d with in sincerity  as with a saint  you do blaspheme the good in mocking me  do not believe it  fewness and truth   tis thus  your brother and his lover have embraced  as those that feed grow full  as blossoming time that from the seedness the bare fallow brings to teeming foison  even so her plenteous womb expresseth his full tilth and husbandry  some one with child by him  my cousin juliet  is she your cousin  adoptedly  as school maids change their names by vain though apt affection  she it is  let him marry her  this is the point  the duke is very strangely gone from hence  bore many gentlemen  myself being one  in hand and hope of action  but we do learn by those that know the very nerves of state  his givings out were of an infinite distance from his true meant design  upon his place  and with full line of his authority  governs lord angelo  a man whose blood is very snow broth  one who never feels the wanton stings and motions of the sense  but doth rebate and blunt his natural edge with profits of the mind  study and fast  he  to give fear to use and liberty  which have for long run by the hideous law  as mice by lions  hath pick d out an act  under whose heavy sense your brother s life falls into forfeit  he arrests him on it  and follows close the rigour of the statute  to make him an example  all hope is gone  unless you have the grace by your fair prayer to soften angelo  and that s my pith of business  twixt you and your poor brother  doth he so seek his life  has censured him already  and  as hear  the provost hath warrant for his execution  alas  what poor ability s in me to do him good  assay the power you have  my power  alas  doubt   our doubts are traitors and make us lose the good we oft might win by fearing to attempt  go to lord angelo  and let him learn to know  when maidens sue  men give like gods  but when they weep and kneel  all their petitions are as freely theirs as they themselves would owe them  i ll see what can do  but speedily  will about it straight  no longer staying but to give the mother notice of my affair  humbly thank you  commend me to my brother  soon at night i ll send him certain word of my success  take my leave of you  good sir  adieu  exeunt hall in angelo s house  enter and a justice  provost  officers  and other attendants  behind we must not make a scarecrow of the law  setting it up to fear the birds of prey  and let it keep

noble father  let but your honour know  whom believe to be most strait in virtue  that  in the working of your own affections  had time cohered with place or place with wishing  or that the resolute acting of your blood could have attain d the effect of your own purpose  whether you had not sometime in your life err d in this point which now you censure him  and pull d the law upon you   tis one thing to be tempted  escalus  another thing to fall  not deny  the jury  passing on the prisoner s life  may in the sworn twelve have a thief or two guiltier than him they try  what s open made to justice  that justice seizes  what know the laws that thieves do pass on thieves   tis very pregnant  the jewel that we find  we stoop and take t because we see it  but what we do not see we tread upon  and never think of it  you may not so extenuate his offence for have had such faults  but rather tell me  when that censure him  do so offend  let mine own judgment pattern out my death  and

save his life    as subscribe not that  nor any other  but in the loss of question   that you  his sister  finding yourself desired of such a person  whose credit with the judge  or own great place  could fetch your brother from the manacles of the all building law  and that there were no earthly mean to save him  but that either you must lay down the treasures of your body to this supposed  or else to let him suffer  what would you do  as much for my poor brother as myself  that is  were under the terms of death  the impression of keen whips i ld wear as rubies  and strip myself to death  as to a bed that longing have been sick for  ere i ld yield my body up to shame  then must your brother die  and  twere the cheaper way  better it were a brother died at once  than that a sister  by redeeming him  should die for ever  were not you then as cruel as the sentence that you have slander d so  ignomy in ransom and free pardon are of two houses  lawful mercy is nothing kin to foul redemption  you seem d of late to make the law a tyrant  and rather proved the sliding of your brother merriment than a vice  pardon me  my lord  it oft falls out  to have what we would have  we speak not what we mean  something do excuse the thing hate  for his advantage that dearly love  we are all frail  else let my brother die  if not a feodary  but only he owe and succeed thy weakness  nay  women are frail too  ay  as the glasses where they view themselves  which are as easy broke as they make forms  women  help heaven  men their creation mar in profiting by them  nay  call us ten times

momentary trick be perdurably fined  isabel  what says my brother  death is a fearful thing  and shamed life a hateful  ay  but to die  and go we know not where  to lie in cold obstruction and to rot  this sensible warm motion to become kneaded clod  and the delighted spirit to bathe in fiery floods  or to reside in thrilling region of thick ribbed ice  to be imprison d in the viewless winds  and blown with restless violence round about the pendent world  or to be worse than worst of those that lawless and incertain thought imagine howling   tis too horrible  the weariest and most loathed worldly life that age  ache  penury and imprisonment can lay on nature is a paradise to what we fear of death  alas  alas  sweet sister  let me live  what sin you do to save a brother s life  nature dispenses with the deed so far that it becomes a virtue  you beast  faithless coward  dishonest wretch  wilt thou be made a man out of my vice  is t not a kind of incest  to take life from thine own

would by and by have some speech with you  the satisfaction would require is likewise your own benefit  have no superfluous leisure  my stay must be stolen out of other affairs  but will attend you awhile  walks apart son  have overheard what hath passed between you and your sister  angelo had never the purpose to corrupt her  only he hath made an essay of her virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition of natures  she  having the truth of honour in her  hath made him that gracious denial which he is most glad to receive  am confessor to angelo  and know this to be true  therefore prepare yourself to death  do not satisfy your resolution with hopes that are fallible  tomorrow you must die  go to your knees and make ready  let me ask my sister pardon  am so out of love with life that will sue to be rid of it  hold you there  farewell  exit provost  a word with you  re enter provost provost what s your will  father that now you are come  you will be gone  leave me awhile with the maid  my mind promises with my habit no loss shall touch her by my company  provost in good time  exit provost  comes forward the hand that hath made you fair hath made you good  the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty brief in goodness  but grace  being the soul of your complexion  shall keep the body of it ever fair  the assault that angelo hath made to you  fortune hath conveyed to my understanding  and  but that frailty hath examples for his falling  should wonder at angelo  how will you do to content this substitute  and to save your brother  am now going to resolve him  had rather my brother die by the law than my son should be unlawfully born  but  how much is the good duke deceived in angelo  if ever he return and can speak to him  will open my lips in vain  or discover his government  that shall not be much amiss  yet  as the matter now stands  he will avoid your accusation  he made trial of you only  therefore fasten your ear on my advisings  to the love have in doing good a remedy presents itself  do make myself believe that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged lady a merited benefit  redeem your brother from the angry law  do no stain to your own gracious person  and much please the absent duke  if peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of this business  let me hear you speak farther  have spirit to do anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit  virtue is bold  and goodness never fearful  have you not heard speak of mariana  the sister of frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea  have heard of the lady  and good words went with her name  she should this angelo have married  was affianced to her by oath  and the nuptial appointed  between which time of the contract and limit of the solemnity  her brother frederick was wrecked at sea  having in that perished vessel the dowry of his sister  but mark how heavily this befell to the poor gentlewoman  there she lost a noble and renowned brother  in his love toward her ever most kind and natural  with him  the portion and sinew of her fortune  her marriage dowry  with both  her combinate husband  this well seeming angelo  can this be so  did angelo so leave her  left her in her tears  and dried not one of them with his comfort  swallowed his vows whole  pretending in her discoveries of dishonour  in few  bestowed her on her own lamentation  which she yet wears for his sake  and he  a marble to her tears  is washed with them  but relents not  what a merit were it in death to take this poor maid from the world  what corruption in this life  that it will let this man live  but how out of this can she avail  it is a rupture that you may easily heal  and the cure of it not only saves your brother  but keeps you from dishonour in doing it  show me how  good father  this forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection  his unjust unkindness  that in all reason should have quenched her love  hath  like an impediment in the current  made it more violent and unruly  go you to angelo  answer his requiring with a plausible obedience  agree with his demands to the point  only refer yourself to this advantage  first  that your stay with him may not be long  that the time may have all shadow and silence in it  and the place answer to convenience  this being granted in course   and now follows all   we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up your appointment  go in your place  if the encounter acknowledge itself hereafter  it may compel him to her recompense  and here  by this  is your brother saved  your honour untainted  the poor mariana advantaged  and the corrupt deputy scaled  the maid will frame and make fit for his attempt  if you think well to carry this as you may  the doubleness of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof  what think you of it  the image of it gives me content already  and trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection  it lies much in your holding up  haste you speedily to angelo  if for this night he entreat you to his bed  give him promise of satisfaction  will presently to saint luke s  there  at the moated grange  resides this

he is with the emperor of russia  other some  he is in rome  but where is he  think you  know not where  but wheresoever  wish him well  it was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from the state  and usurp the beggary he was never born to  lord angelo dukes it well in his absence  he puts transgression to  t  he does well in  t  little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in him  something too crabbed that way  friar  it is too general a vice  and severity must cure it  yes  in good sooth  the vice is of a great kindred  it is well allied  but it is impossible to extirp it quite  friar  till eating and drinking be put down  they say this angelo was not made by man and woman after this downright way of creation  is it true  think you  how should he be made  then  some report a sea maid spawned him  some  that he was begot between two stock fishes  but it is certain that when he makes water his urine is congealed ice  that know to be true  and he is a motion generative  that s infallible  you are pleasant  sir  and speak apace  why  what a ruthless thing is this in him  for the rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a man  would the duke that is absent have done this  ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a hundred bastards  he would have paid for the nursing a thousand  he had some feeling of the sport  he knew the service  and that instructed him to mercy  never heard the absent duke much detected for women  he was not inclined that way  sir  you are deceived   tis not possible  who  not the duke  yes  your beggar of fifty  and his use was to put a ducat in her clack dish  the duke had crotchets in him  he would be drunk too  that let me inform you  you do him wrong  surely  sir  was an inward of his  shy fellow was the duke  and believe know the cause of his withdrawing  what  prithee  might be the cause  no  pardon   tis a secret must be locked within the teeth and the lips  but this can let you understand  the greater file of the subject held the duke to be wise  wise  why  no question but he was  very superficial  ignorant  unweighing fellow  either this is the envy in you  folly  or mistaking  the very stream of his life and the business he hath helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better proclamation  let him be but testimonied in his own bringings forth  and he shall appear to the envious a scholar  a statesman and a soldier  therefore you speak unskilfully  or if your knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice  sir  know him  and love him  love talks with better knowledge  and knowledge with dearer love  come  sir  know what know  can hardly believe that  since you know not what you speak  but  if ever the duke return  as our prayers are he may  let me desire you to make your answer

that barnardine who is to be executed in the afternoon  provost bohemian born  but here nursed un and bred  one that is a prisoner nine years old  how came it that the absent duke had not either delivered him to his liberty or executed him  have heard it was ever his manner to do so  provost his friends still wrought reprieves for him  and  indeed  his fact  till now in the government of lord angelo  came not to an undoubtful proof  it is now apparent  provost most manifest  and not denied by himself  hath he born himself penitently in prison  how seems he to be touched  provost man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but as a drunken sleep  careless  reckless  and fearless of what s past  present  or to come  insensible of mortality  and desperately mortal  he wants advice  provost he will hear none  he hath evermore had the liberty of the prison  give him leave to escape hence  he would not  drunk many times a day  if not many days entirely drunk  we have very oft awaked him  as if to carry him to execution  and showed him a seeming warrant for it  it hath not moved him at all  more of him anon  there is written in your brow  provost  honesty and constancy  if read it not truly  my ancient skill beguiles me  but  in the boldness of my cunning  will lay myself in hazard  claudio  whom here you have warrant to execute  is no greater forfeit to the law than angelo who hath sentenced him  to make you understand this in a manifested effect  crave but four days  respite  for the which you are to do me both a present and a dangerous courtesy  provost pray  sir  in what  in the delaying death  provost lack  how may do it  having the hour limited  and an express command  under penalty  to deliver his head in the view of angelo  may make my case as claudio

hath seen them both  and will discover the favour  death s a great disguiser  and you may add to it  shave the head  and tie the beard  and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his death  you know the course is common  if any thing fall to you upon this  more than thanks and good fortune  by the saint whom profess  will plead against it with my life  provost pardon me  good

 the contents of this is the return of the duke  you shall anon over read it at your pleasure  where you shall find  within these two days he will be here  this is a thing that angelo knows not  for he this very day receives letters of strange tenor  perchance of the duke s death  perchance entering into some monastery  but  by chance  nothing of what is writ  look  the unfolding star calls up the shepherd  put not yourself into amazement how these things should be  all difficulties are but easy when they are known  call your executioner  and off with barnardine s head  will give him a

speak  that angelo s forsworn  is it not strange  that angelo s a murderer  is  t not strange  that angelo is an adulterous thief  an hypocrite  a virgin violator  is it not strange and strange  nay  it is ten times strange  it is not truer he is angelo than this is all as true as it is strange  nay  it is ten times true  for truth is truth to the end of reckoning  away with her  poor soul  she speaks this in the infirmity of sense  prince  conjure thee  as thou believest there is another comfort than this world  that thou neglect me not  with that opinion that am touch d with madness  make not impossible that which but seems unlike   tis not impossible but one  the wicked st caitiff on the ground  may seem as shy  as grave  as just  as absolute as angelo  even so may angelo  in all his

this was of much length   the vile conclusion now begin with grief and shame to utter  he would not  but by gift of my chaste body to his concupiscible intemperate lust  release my brother  and  after much debatement  my sisterly remorse confutes mine honour  and did yield to him  but the next morn betimes  his purpose surfeiting  he sends a warrant for my poor brother s head  this is most likely
