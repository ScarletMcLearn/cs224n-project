drew to part them  in the instant came the fiery tybalt  with his sword prepared  which  as he breathed defiance to my ears  he swung about his head and cut the winds  who nothing hurt withal hiss d him in scorn  while we were interchanging thrusts and blows  came more and more and fought on part and part  till the prince came  who parted either part  where is romeo  saw you him to day  right glad am he was not at this fray  madam  an hour before the worshipp d sun peer d forth the golden window of the east  troubled mind drave me to walk abroad  where  underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city s side  so early walking did see your son  towards him made  but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood  measuring his affections by my own  that most are busied when they re most alone  pursued my humour not pursuing his  and gladly shunn d who gladly fled from me  many a morning hath he there been seen  with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew  adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs  but all so soon as the all cheering sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora s bed  away from the light steals home my heavy son  and private in his chamber pens himself  shuts up his windows  locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night  black and portentous must this humour prove  unless good counsel may the cause remove  my noble uncle  do you know the cause  neither know it nor can learn of him  have you importuned him by any means  both by myself and many other friends  but he  his own affections  counsellor  is to himself  i will not say how true   but to himself so secret and so close  so far from sounding and discovery  as is the bud bit with an envious worm  ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air  or dedicate his beauty to the sun  could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow  we would as willingly give cure as know  enter see  where he comes  so please you  step aside  i ll know his grievance  or be much denied  would thou wert so happy by thy stay  to hear true shrift  come  madam  let s away  exeunt and good morrow  cousin  is the day so

love  out   of love  out of her favour  where am in love  alas  that love  so gentle in his view  should be so tyrannous and rough in proof  alas  that love  whose view is muffled still  should  without eyes  see pathways to his will  where shall we dine  me  what fray was here  yet tell me not  for have heard it all  here s much to do with hate  but more with love  why  then  brawling love

griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast  which thou wilt propagate  to have it prest with more of thine  this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own  love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs  being purged  a fire sparkling in lovers  eyes  being vex d a sea nourish d with lovers  tears  what is it else  a madness most discreet  choking gall and a preserving sweet  farewell  my coz  soft  will go along  an if you leave me so  you do me wrong  tut  have lost myself  am not here  this is not romeo  he s some other where  tell me in sadness  who is that you

ope her lap to saint seducing gold  she is rich in beauty  only poor  that when she dies with beauty dies her store  then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste  she hath  and in that sparing makes huge waste  for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity  she is too fair  too wise  wisely too fair  to merit bliss by making me despair  she hath forsworn to love  and in that vow do live dead that live to tell it now  be ruled by me  forget to think of her  teach me how should forget to think  by giving liberty unto thine eyes  examine other beauties   tis the way to call hers exquisite  in question more  these happy masks that kiss fair ladies  brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair  he that is strucken blind cannot forget the precious

bed asleep  while they do dream things true  then  see queen mab hath been with you  she is the fairies  midwife  and she comes in shape no bigger than an agate stone on the fore finger of an alderman  drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men s noses as they lie asleep  her wagon spokes made of long spiders  legs  the cover of the wings of grasshoppers  the traces of the smallest spider s web  the collars of the moonshine s watery beams  her whip of cricket s bone  the lash of film  her wagoner a small grey coated gnat  not so big as a round little worm prick d from the lazy finger of a maid  her chariot is an empty hazel nut made by the joiner squirrel or old grub  time out o  mind the fairies  coachmakers  and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers  brains  and then they dream of love  o er courtiers  knees  that dream on court sies straight  o er lawyers  fingers  who straight dream on fees  o er ladies   lips  who straight on kisses dream  which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues  because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are  sometime she gallops o er a courtier s nose  and then dreams he of smelling out a suit  and sometime comes she with a tithe pig s tail tickling a parson s nose as a  lies asleep  then dreams  he of another benefice  sometime she driveth o er a soldier s neck  and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats  of breaches  ambuscadoes  spanish blades  of healths five fathom deep  and then anon drums in his ear  at which he starts and wakes  and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again  this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night  and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs  which once untangled  much misfortune bodes  this is the hag  when maids lie on their backs  that presses them and learns them first to bear  making them women of good carriage  this is she   peace  peace  mercutio  peace  thou talk st of nothing  true  talk of dreams  which are the children of an idle brain  begot of nothing but vain fantasy  which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind  who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north  and  being anger d  puffs away from thence  turning his face to the dew dropping south  this wind  you talk of  blows us from ourselves  supper is done  and we shall come too late  fear  too early  for my mind misgives
