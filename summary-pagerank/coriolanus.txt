Citizens No, no, no, no, no. Citizens It shall be so, it shall be so. But, let it come. Come, come, come. All Come, come. Come, let's away. AEdile He's coming. But, come, let's home. Come, you shall go with us. Come, enter with us. First Citizen The gods be good to us! First Senator Pray you, let's to him. She shall, she shall. 'Shall'! Second Citizen So did we all. Second Citizen We may, sir, if we will. Shall's to the Capitol? Come, let's not weep. Citizens It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away: He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
