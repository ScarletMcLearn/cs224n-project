'tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise in. the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek. no more of this, helena; go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it. do affect a sorrow indeed, but have it too. moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, excessive grief the enemy to the living. if the living be enemy to the grief, the excess makes it soon mortal. madam, desire your holy wishes. how understand we that? be thou blest, bertram, and succeed thy father in manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness share with thy birthright! love all, trust a few, do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy rather in power than use, and keep thy friend under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, but never tax'd for speech. what heaven more will, that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, fall on thy head! farewell, my lord; 'tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, advise him. he cannot want the best that shall attend his love. heaven bless him! farewell, bertram. exit to the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you! be comfortable to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her. farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of your father. exeunt and were that all! think not on my father; and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those shed for him. what was he like? have forgot him: my imagination carries no favour in't but bertram's. am undone: there is no living, none, if bertram be away. 'twere all one that should love a bright particular star and think to wed it, he is so above me: in his bright radiance and collateral light must be comforted, not in his sphere. the ambition in my love thus plagues itself: the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love. 'twas pretty, though plague, to see him every hour; to sit and draw his arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, in our heart's table; heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour: but now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques. who comes here? enter aside one that goes with him: love him for his sake; and yet know him a notorious liar, think him a great way fool, solely a coward; yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, that they take place, when virtue's steely bones look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. save you, fair queen! and you, monarch! no. and no. are you meditating on virginity? ay. you have some stain of soldier in you: let me ask you a question. man is enemy to virginity; how may we barricado it against him? keep him out. but he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some warlike resistance. there is none: man, sitting down before you, will undermine you and blow you up. bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up! is there no military policy, how virgins might blow up men? virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity. loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost. that you were made of is metal to make virgins. virginity by being once lost may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't! will stand for 't a little, though therefore die a virgin. there's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the rule of nature. to speak on the part of virginity, is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible disobedience. he that hangs himself is a virgin: virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate offendress against nature. virginity breeds mites, much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the canon. keep it not; you cannot choose but loose by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the principal itself not much the worse: away with 't! how might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it likes. 'tis a commodity will lose the gloss with lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not now. your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, your old virginity, is like one of our french withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, 'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it? not my virginity yet there shall your master have a thousand loves, mother and a mistress and a friend, phoenix, captain and an enemy, guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; his humble ambition, proud humility, his jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, his faith, his sweet disaster; with a world of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms, that blinking cupid gossips. now shall he-- know not what he shall. god send him well! the court's a learning place, and he is one-- what one, i' faith? that wish well. 'tis pity-- what's pity? that wishing well had not a body in't, which might be felt; that we, the poorer born, whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, might with effects of them follow our friends, and show what we alone must think, which never return us thanks. enter page page monsieur parolles, my lord calls for you. exit little helen, farewell; if can remember thee, will think of thee at court. monsieur parolles, you were born under a charitable star. under mars, especially think, under mars. why under mars? the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars. when he was predominant. when he was retrograde, think, rather. why think you so? you go so much backward when you fight. that's for advantage. so is running away, when fear proposes the safety; but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing, and like the wear well. am so full of businesses, cannot answer thee acutely. will return perfect courtier; in the which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. when thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband, and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell. exit our remedies oft in ourselves do lie, which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky gives us free scope, only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull. what power is it which mounts my love so high, that makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye? the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things. impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been cannot be: who ever strove so show her merit, that did miss her love? the king's disease--my project may deceive me, but my intents are fix'd and will not leave me. exit paris. the king's palace. flourish of cornets. enter the of france, with letters, and divers attendants the florentines and senoys are by the ears; have fought with equal fortune and continue braving war. first lord so 'tis reported, sir. nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it certainty, vouch'd from our cousin austria, with caution that the florentine will move us for speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business and would seem to have us make denial. first lord his love and wisdom, approved so to your majesty, may plead for amplest credence. he hath arm'd our answer, and florence is denied before he comes: yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service, freely have they leave to stand on either part. second lord it well may serve nursery to our gentry, who are sick for breathing and exploit. what's he comes here? enter and first lord it is the count rousillon, my good lord, young bertram. youth, thou bear'st thy father's face; frank nature, rather curious than in haste, hath well composed thee. thy father's moral parts mayst thou inherit too! welcome to paris. my thanks and duty are your majesty's. would had that corporal soundness now, as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership! he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest: he lasted long; but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act. it much repairs me to talk of your good father. in his youth he had the wit which can well observe to-day in our young lords; but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour; so like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness; if they were, his equal had awaked them, and his honour, clock to itself, knew the true minute when exception bid him speak, and at this time his tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, making them proud of his humility, in their poor praise he humbled. such a man might be a copy to these younger times; which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now but goers backward. his good remembrance, sir, lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb; so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech. would were with him! he would always say-- methinks hear him now; his plausive words he scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them, to grow there and to bear,--'let me not live,'-- this his good melancholy oft began, on the catastrophe and heel of pastime, when it was out,--'let me not live,' quoth he, 'after my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain; whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies expire before their fashions.' this he wish'd; after him do after him wish too, since nor wax nor honey can bring home, quickly were dissolved from my hive, to give some labourers room. second lord you are loved, sir: they that least lend it you shall lack you first. fill a place, know't. how long is't, count, since the physician at your father's died? he was much famed. some six months since, my lord. if he were living, would try him yet. lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out with several applications; nature and sickness debate it at their leisure. welcome, count; my son's no dearer. thank your majesty. exeunt. flourish rousillon. the count's palace. enter steward, and clown will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman? steward madam, the care have had to even your content, wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings, when of ourselves we publish them. what does this knave here? get you gone, sirrah: the complaints have heard of you do not all believe: 'tis my slowness that do not; for know you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours. clown 'tis not unknown to you, madam, am a poor fellow. well, sir. clown no, madam, 'tis not so well that am poor, though many of the rich are damned: but, if may have your ladyship's good will to go to the world, isbel the woman and will do as we may. wilt thou needs be a beggar? clown do beg your good will in this case. in what case? clown in isbel's case and mine own. service is no heritage: and think shall never have the blessing of god till have issue o' my body; for they say barnes are blessings. tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry. clown my poor body, madam, requires it: am driven on by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives. is this all your worship's reason? clown faith, madam, have other holy reasons such as they are. may the world know them? clown have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, do marry that may repent. thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness. clown am out o' friends, madam; and hope to have friends for my wife's sake. such friends are thine enemies, knave. clown you're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the knaves come to do that for me which am aweary of. he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop; if be his cuckold, he's my drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses my wife is my friend. if men could be contented to be what they are, there were no fear in marriage; for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl horns together, like any deer i' the herd. wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave? clown prophet madam; and speak the truth the next way: for the ballad will repeat, which men full true shall find; your marriage comes by destiny, your cuckoo sings by kind. get you gone, sir; i'll talk with you more anon. steward may it please you, madam, that he bid helen come to you: of her am to speak. sirrah, tell my gentlewoman would speak with her; helen, mean. clown was this fair face the cause, quoth she, why the grecians sacked troy? fond done, done fond, was this king priam's joy? with that she sighed as she stood, with that she sighed as she stood, and gave this sentence then; among nine bad if one be good, among nine bad if one be good, there's yet one good in ten. what, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah. clown one good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying o' the song: would god would serve the world so all the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman, if were the parson. one in ten, quoth a'! an we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck one. you'll be gone, sir knave, and do as command you. clown that man should be at woman's command, and yet no hurt done! though honesty be no puritan, yet it will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart. am going, forsooth: the business is for helen to come hither. exit well, now. steward know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely. faith, do: her father bequeathed her to me; and she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds: there is more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid her than she'll demand. steward madam, was very late more near her than think she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears; she thought, dare vow for her, they touched not any stranger sense. her matter was, she loved your son: fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put such difference betwixt their two estates; love no god, that would not extend his might, only where qualities were level; dian no queen of virgins, that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward. this she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that e'er heard virgin exclaim in: which held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal; sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns you something to know it. you have discharged this honestly; keep it to yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this before, which hung so tottering in the balance that could neither believe nor misdoubt. pray you, leave me: stall this in your bosom; and thank you for your honest care: will speak with you further anon. exit steward enter even so it was with me when was young: if ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong; our blood to us, this to our blood is born; it is the show and seal of nature's truth, where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth: by our remembrances of days foregone, such were our faults, or then we thought them none. her eye is sick on't: observe her now. what is your pleasure, madam? you know, helen, am a mother to you. mine honourable mistress. nay, a mother: why not a mother? when said 'a mother,' methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,' that you start at it? say, am your mother; and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds native slip to us from foreign seeds: you ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan, yet express to you a mother's care: god's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood to say am thy mother? what's the matter, that this distemper'd messenger of wet, the many-colour'd iris, rounds thine eye? why? that you are my daughter? that am not. say, am your mother. pardon, madam; the count rousillon cannot be my brother: am from humble, he from honour'd name; no note upon my parents, his all noble: my master, my dear lord he is; and his servant live, and will his vassal die: he must not be my brother. nor your mother? you are my mother, madam; would you were,-- so that my lord your son were not my brother,-- indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers, care no more for than do for heaven, so were not his sister. can't no other, but, your daughter, he must be my brother? yes, helen, you might be my daughter-in-law: god shield you mean it not! daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse. what, pale again? my fear hath catch'd your fondness: now see the mystery of your loneliness, and find your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross you love my son; invention is ashamed, against the proclamation of thy passion, to say thou dost not: therefore tell me true; but tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors that in their kind they speak it: only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue, that truth should be suspected. speak, is't so? if it be so, you have wound a goodly clew; if it be not, forswear't: howe'er, charge thee, as heaven shall work in me for thine avail, tell me truly. good madam, pardon me! do you love my son? your pardon, noble mistress! love you my son? do not you love him, madam? go not about; my love hath in't a bond, whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose the state of your affection; for your passions have to the full appeach'd. then, confess, here on my knee, before high heaven and you, that before you, and next unto high heaven, love your son. my friends were poor, but honest; so's my love: be not offended; for it hurts not him that he is loved of me: follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit; nor would have him till do deserve him; yet never know how that desert should be. know love in vain, strive against hope; yet in this captious and intenible sieve still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still: thus, indian-like, religious in mine error, adore the sun, that looks upon his worshipper, but knows of him no more. my dearest madam, let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do: but if yourself, whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth, did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly, that your dian was both herself and love: then, give pity to her, whose state is such that cannot choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose; that seeks not to find that her search implies, but riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies! had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,-- to go to paris? madam, had. wherefore? tell true. will tell truth; by grace itself swear. you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects, such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty; and that he will'd me in heedfull'st reservation to bestow them, as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note: amongst the rest, there is a remedy, approved, set down, to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render'd lost. this was your motive for paris, was it? speak. my lord your son made me to think of this; else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then. but think you, helen, if you should tender your supposed aid, he would receive it? he and his physicians are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him, they, that they cannot help: how shall they credit poor unlearned virgin, when the schools, embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off the danger to itself? there's something in't, more than my father's skill, which was the greatest of his profession, that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour but give me leave to try success, i'ld venture the well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure by such a day and hour. dost thou believe't? ay, madam, knowingly. why, helen, thou shalt have my leave and love, means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court: i'll stay at home and pray god's blessing into thy attempt: be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this, what can help thee to thou shalt not miss. exeunt paris. the king's palace. flourish of cornets. enter the attended with divers young lords taking leave for the florentine war; and farewell, young lords; these warlike principles do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell: share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all the gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received, and is enough for both. first lord 'tis our hope, sir, after well enter'd soldiers, to return and find your grace in health. no, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart will not confess he owes the malady that doth my life besiege. farewell, young lords; whether live or die, be you the sons of worthy frenchmen: let higher italy,-- those bated that inherit but the fall of the last monarchy,--see that you come not to woo honour, but to wed it; when the bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek, that fame may cry you loud: say, farewell. second lord health, at your bidding, serve your majesty! those girls of italy, take heed of them: they say, our french lack language to deny, if they demand: beware of being captives, before you serve. both our hearts receive your warnings. farewell. come hither to me. exit, attended first lord my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

no. will you eat no grapes, my royal fox? yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if my royal fox could reach them: have seen a medicine that's able to breathe life into a stone, quicken a rock, and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch, is powerful to araise king pepin, nay, to give great charlemain a pen in's hand, and write to her a love-line. what 'her' is this? why, doctor she: my lord, there's one arrived, if you will see her: now, by my faith and honour, if seriously may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance, have spoke with one that, in her sex, her years, profession, wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more than dare blame my weakness: will you see her for that is her demand, and know her business?

ay, my good lord. gerard de narbon was my father; in what he did profess, well found. knew him. the rather will spare my praises towards him: knowing him is enough. on's bed of death many receipts he gave me: chiefly one. which, as the dearest issue of his practise, and of his old experience the oily darling, he bade me store up, as a triple eye, safer than mine own two, more dear; have so; and hearing your high majesty is touch'd with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear father's gift stands chief in power, come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness. we thank you, maiden; but may not be so credulous of cure, when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidible estate; say we must not so stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope, to prostitute our past-cure malady to empirics, or to dissever so our great self and our credit, to esteem senseless help when help past sense we deem. my duty then shall pay me for my pains: will no more enforce mine office on you. humbly entreating from your royal thoughts modest one, to bear me back a again. cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful: thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks give as one near death to those that wish him live: but what at full know, thou know'st no part, knowing all my peril, thou no art. what can do can do no hurt to try, since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy. he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister: so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown, when judges have been babes; great floods have flown from simple sources, and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied. oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises, and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits. must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid; thy pains not used must by thyself be paid: proffers not took reap thanks for their reward. inspired merit so by breath is barr'd: it is not so with him that all things knows as 'tis with us that square our guess by shows; but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men. dear sir, to my endeavours give consent; of heaven, not me, make an experiment. am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim; but know think and think know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure. are thou so confident? within what space hopest thou my cure? the great'st grace lending grace ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring, ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp, or four and twenty times the pilot's glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass, what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly, health shall live free and sickness freely die. upon thy certainty and confidence what darest thou venture?

but to the court! clown truly, madam, if god have lent a man any manners, he may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing, has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the court; but for me, have an answer will serve all men. marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all questions. clown it is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks, the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn buttock, or any buttock. will your answer serve fit to all questions? clown as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney, as your french crown for your taffeta punk, as tib's rush for tom's forefinger, as a pancake for shrove tuesday, a morris for may-day, as the nail to his hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin. have you, say, an answer of such fitness for all questions? clown from below your duke to beneath your constable, it will fit any question. it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands. clown but a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that belongs to't. ask me if am a courtier: it shall do you no harm to learn. to be young again, if we could: will be a fool in question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

'tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which can build up. strange is it that our bloods, of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together, would quite confound distinction, yet stand off in differences so mighty. if she be all that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest, poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest of virtue for the name: but do not so: from lowest place when virtuous things proceed, the place is dignified by the doer's deed: where great additions swell's, and virtue none, it is a dropsied honour. good alone is good without a name. vileness is so: the property by what it is should go, not by the title. she is young, wise, fair; in these to nature she's immediate heir, and these breed honour: that is honour's scorn, which challenges itself as honour's born and is not like the sire: honours thrive, when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave lying trophy, and as oft is dumb where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb of honour'd bones indeed. what should be said? if thou canst like this creature as a maid, can create the rest: virtue and she is her own dower; honour and wealth from me. cannot love her, nor will strive to do't. thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose. that you are well restored, my lord, i'm glad: let the rest go. my honour's at the stake; which to defeat, must produce my power. here, take her hand, proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift; that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert; that canst not dream, we, poising us in her defective scale, shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know, it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow. cheque thy contempt: obey our will, which travails in thy good: believe not thy disdain, but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims; or will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee, in the name of justice, without all terms of pity. speak; thine answer. pardon, my gracious lord; for submit my fancy to your eyes: when consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it, find that she, which late was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now the praised of the king; who, so ennobled, is as 'twere born so. take her by the hand, and tell her she is thine: to whom promise counterpoise, if not to thy estate balance more replete. take her hand. good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract; whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the now-born brief, and be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space, expecting absent friends. as thou lovest her, thy love's to me religious; else, does err. exeunt all but and advancing do you hear, monsieur?

widow if you shall please so, pilgrim. thank you, and will stay upon your leisure. widow you came, think, from france? did so. widow here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service. his name, pray you. the count rousillon: know you such a one? but by the ear, that hears most nobly of him: his face know not. whatsome'er he is, he's bravely taken here. he stole from france, as 'tis reported, for the king had married him against his liking: think you it is so? ay, surely, mere the truth: know his lady. there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her. what's his name? monsieur parolles. believe with him, in argument of praise, or to the worth of the great count himself, she is too mean to have her name repeated: all her deserving is a reserved honesty, and that have not heard examined. alas, poor lady! 'tis a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord. widow warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is, her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her shrewd turn, if she pleased. how do you mean? may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose. widow he does indeed; and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid: but she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence. the gods forbid else! widow so, now they come: drum and colours enter and the whole army that is antonio, the duke's eldest son; that, escalus. which is the frenchman? he; that with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow. would he loved his wife: if he were honester he were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman? like him well. 'tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave that leads him to these places: were his lady, would poison that vile rascal. which is he? that jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy? perchance he's hurt i' the battle. lose our drum! well. he's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us. widow marry, hang you! and your courtesy, for a ring-carrier! exeunt and army widow the troop is past. come, pilgrim, will bring you where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents there's four or five, to great saint jaques bound, already at my house. humbly thank you: please it this matron and this gentle maid to eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking shall be for me; and, to requite you further, will bestow some precepts of this virgin worthy the note. we'll take your offer kindly. exeunt camp before florence. enter and the two french lords second lord nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his way. first lord if your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no more in your respect. second lord on my life, my lord, a bubble. do you think am so far deceived in him? second lord believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, without any malice, but to speak of him as my kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship's entertainment. first lord it were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you. would knew in what particular action to try him. first lord none better than to let him fetch off his drum, which you hear him so confidently undertake to do. second lord with a troop of florentines, will suddenly surprise him; such will have, whom am sure he knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when we bring him to our own tents. be but your lordship present at his examination: if he do not, for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you, and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never trust my judgment in any thing. first lord for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; he says he has a stratagem for't: when your lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted, if you give him not john drum's entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed. here he comes. enter second lord aside to for the love of laughter, hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch off his drum in any hand. how now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your disposition. first lord pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum. 'but a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? drum so lost! there was excellent command,--to charge in with our horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers! first lord that was not to be blamed in the command of the service: it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented, if he had been there to command. well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is not to be recovered. it might have been recovered. it might; but it is not now. it is to be recovered: but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer, would have that drum or another, or 'hic jacet.' why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it. and extend to you what further becomes his greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness. by the hand of a soldier, will undertake it. but you must not now slumber in it. i'll about it this evening: and will presently pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation; and by midnight look to hear further from me. may be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it? know not what the success will be, my lord; but the attempt vow. know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. farewell. love not many words. exit second lord no more than a fish loves water. is not this a strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems to undertake this business, which he knows is not to be done; damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to do't? first lord you do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but when you find him out, you have him ever after. why, do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto? second lord none in the world; but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect. first lord we'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case him. he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu: when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this very night. second lord must go look my twigs: he shall be caught. your brother he shall go along with me. second lord as't please your lordship: i'll leave you. exit now will lead you to the house, and show you the lass spoke of. first lord but you say she's honest. that's all the fault: spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold; but sent to her, by this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind, tokens and letters which she did re-send; and this is all have done. she's a fair creature: will you go see her? first lord with all my heart, my lord. exeunt florence. the widow's house. enter and widow if you misdoubt me that am not she, know not how shall assure you further, but shall lose the grounds work upon. widow though my estate be fallen, was well born, nothing acquainted with these businesses; and would not put my reputation now in any staining act. nor would wish you. first, give me trust, the count he is my husband, and what to your sworn counsel have spoken is so from word to word; and then you cannot, by the good aid that of you shall borrow, err in bestowing it. widow should believe you: for you have show'd me that which well approves you're great in fortune. take this purse of gold, and let me buy your friendly help thus far, which will over-pay and pay again when have found it. the count he wooes your daughter, lays down his wanton siege before her beauty, resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent, as we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it. now his important blood will nought deny that she'll demand: a ring the county wears, that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son, some four or five descents since the first father wore it: this ring he holds in most rich choice; yet in his idle fire, to buy his will, it would not seem too dear, howe'er repented after. widow now see the bottom of your purpose. you see it lawful, then: it is no more, but that your daughter, ere she seems as won, desires this ring; appoints him an encounter; in fine, delivers me to fill the time, herself most chastely absent: after this, to marry her, i'll add three thousand crowns to what is passed already. widow have yielded: instruct my daughter how she shall persever, that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent. every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness: it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves; for he persists as if his life lay on't. why then to-night let us assay our plot; which, if it speed, is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act, where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact: but let's about it. exeunt without the florentine camp. enter second french lord, with five or six other soldiers in ambush second lord he can come no other way but by this hedge-corner. when you sally upon him, speak what terrible language you will: though you understand it not yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to understand him, unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter. first soldier good captain, let me be the interpreter. second lord art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice? first soldier no, sir, warrant you. second lord but what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again? first soldier e'en such as you speak to me. second lord he must think us some band of strangers i' the adversary's entertainment. now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to know straight our purpose: choughs' language, gabble enough, and good enough. as for you, interpreter, you must seem very politic. but couch, ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep, and then to return and swear the lies he forges. enter ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be time enough to go home. what shall say have done? it must be a very plausive invention that carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door. find my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures, not daring the reports of my tongue. second lord this is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue was guilty of. what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the impossibility, and knowing had no such purpose? must give myself some hurts, and say got them in exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they will say, 'came you off with so little?' and great ones dare not give. wherefore, what's the instance? tongue, must put you into a butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils. second lord is it possible he should know what he is, and be that he is? would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn, or the breaking of my spanish sword. second lord we cannot afford you so. or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in stratagem. second lord 'twould not do. or to drown my clothes, and say was stripped. second lord hardly serve. though swore leaped from the window of the citadel. second lord how deep? thirty fathom. second lord three great oaths would scarce make that be believed. would had any drum of the enemy's: would swear recovered it. second lord you shall hear one anon. drum now of the enemy's,-- alarum within second lord throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo. all cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo. ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes. they seize and blindfold him first soldier boskos thromuldo boskos. know you are the muskos' regiment: and shall lose my life for want of language; if there be here german, or dane, low dutch, italian, or french, let him speak to me; i'll discover that which shall undo the florentine. first soldier boskos vauvado: understand thee, and can speak thy tongue. kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom. first soldier pray, pray, pray! manka revania dulche. second lord oscorbidulchos volivorco. first soldier the general is content to spare thee yet; and, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on to gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform something to save thy life. let me live! and all the secrets of our camp i'll show, their force, their purposes; nay, i'll speak that which you will wonder at. first soldier but wilt thou faithfully? if do not, damn me. first soldier acordo linta. come on; thou art granted space. exit, with guarded. short alarum within second lord go, tell the count rousillon, and my brother, we have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled till we do hear from them. second soldier captain, will. second lord a' will betray us all unto ourselves: inform on that. second soldier so will, sir. second lord till then i'll keep him dark and safely lock'd. exeunt florence. the widow's house. enter and they told me that your name was fontibell. no, my good lord, diana. titled goddess; and worth it, with addition! but, fair soul, in your fine frame hath love no quality? if quick fire of youth light not your mind, you are no maiden, but a monument: when you are dead, you should be such a one as you are now, for you are cold and stem; and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got. she then was honest. so should you be. no: my mother did but duty; such, my lord, as you owe to your wife. no more o' that; prithee, do not strive against my vows: was compell'd to her; but love thee by love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever do thee all rights of service. ay, so you serve us till we serve you; but when you have our roses, you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness. how have sworn! 'tis not the many oaths that makes the truth, but the plain single vow that is vow'd true. what is not holy, that we swear not by, but take the high'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me, if should swear by god's great attributes, loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths, when did love you ill? this has no holding, to swear by him whom protest to love, that will work against him: therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd, at least in my opinion. change it, change it; be not so holy-cruel: love is holy; and my integrity ne'er knew the crafts that you do charge men with. stand no more off, but give thyself unto my sick desires, who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever my love as it begins shall so persever. see that men make ropes in such a scarre that we'll forsake ourselves. give me that ring. i'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power to give it from me. will you not, my lord? it is an honour 'longing to our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors; which were the greatest obloquy i' the world in me to lose. mine honour's such a ring: my chastity's the jewel of our house, bequeathed down from many ancestors; which were the greatest obloquy i' the world in me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part, against your vain assault. here, take my ring: my house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine, and i'll be bid by thee. when midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window: i'll order take my mother shall not hear. now will charge you in the band of truth, when you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed, remain there but an hour, nor speak to me: my reasons are most strong; and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver'd: and on your finger in the night i'll put another ring, that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds. adieu, till then; then, fail not. you have won wife of me, though there my hope be done. heaven on earth have won by wooing thee. exit for which live long to thank both heaven and me! you may so in the end. my mother told me just how he would woo, as if she sat in 's heart; she says all men have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me when his wife's dead; therefore i'll lie with him when am buried. since frenchmen are so braid, marry that will, live and die a maid: only in this disguise think't no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win. exit the florentine camp. enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers first lord you have not given him his mother's letter? second lord have delivered it an hour since: there is something in't that stings his nature; for on the reading it he changed almost into another man. first lord he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady. second lord especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him. will tell you a thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you. first lord when you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and am the grave of it. second lord he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition. first lord now, god delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves, what things are we! second lord merely our own traitors. and as in the common course of all treasons, we still see them reveal themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends, so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself. first lord is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents? we shall not then have his company to-night? second lord not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour. first lord that approaches apace; would gladly have him see his company anatomized, that he might take a measure of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit. second lord we will not meddle with him till he come; for his presence must be the whip of the other. first lord in the mean time, what hear you of these wars? second lord hear there is an overture of peace. first lord nay, assure you, a peace concluded. second lord what will count rousillon do then? will he travel higher, or return again into france? first lord perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether of his council. second lord let it be forbid, sir; so should be a great deal of his act. first lord sir, his wife some two months since fled from his house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand; which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and now she sings in heaven. second lord how is this justified? first lord the stronger part of it by her own letters, which makes her story true, even to the point of her death: her death itself, which could not be her office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place. second lord hath the count all this intelligence? first lord ay, and the particular confirmations, point from point, so to the full arming of the verity. second lord am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this. first lord how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses! second lord and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears! the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample. first lord the web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our faults whipped them not; and our crimes would despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues. enter a messenger how now! where's your master? servant he met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next morning for france. the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king. second lord they shall be no more than needful there, if they were more than they can commend. first lord they cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness. here's his lordship now. enter how now, my lord! is't not after midnight? have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success: have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my lady mother am returning; entertained my convoy; and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but that have not ended yet. second lord if the business be of any difficulty, and this morning your departure hence, it requires haste of your lordship. mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to hear of it hereafter. but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier? come, bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived me, like a double-meaning prophesier. second lord bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night, poor gallant knave. no matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping his spurs so long. how does he carry himself? second lord have told your lordship already, the stocks carry him. but to answer you as you would be understood; he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he hath confessed himself to morgan, whom he supposes to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i' the stocks: and what think you he hath confessed? nothing of me, has a'? second lord his confession is taken, and it shall be read to his face: if your lordship be in't, as believe you are, you must have the patience to hear it. enter guarded, and first soldier plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of me: hush, hush! first lord hoodman comes! portotartarosa first soldier he calls for the tortures: what will you say without 'em? will confess what know without constraint: if ye pinch me like a pasty, can say no more. first soldier bosko chimurcho. first lord boblibindo chicurmurco. first soldier you are a merciful general. our general bids you answer to what shall ask you out of a note. and truly, as hope to live. first soldier reads 'first demand of him how many horse the duke is strong.' what say you to that? five or six thousand; but very weak and unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation and credit and as hope to live. first soldier shall set down your answer so? do: i'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will. all's one to him. what a past-saving slave is this! first lord you're deceived, my lord: this is monsieur parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of his dagger. second lord will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly. first soldier well, that's set down. five or six thousand horse, said,-- will say true,--or thereabouts, set down, for i'll speak truth. first lord he's very near the truth in this. but con him no thanks for't, in the nature he delivers it. poor rogues, pray you, say. first soldier well, that's set down. humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the rogues are marvellous poor. first soldier reads 'demand of him, of what strength they are a-foot.' what say you to that? by my troth, sir, if were to live this present hour, will tell true. let me see: spurio, a hundred and fifty; sebastian, so many; corambus, so many; jaques, so many; guiltian, cosmo, lodowick, and gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own company, chitopher, vaumond, bentii, two hundred and fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces. what shall be done to him? first lord nothing, but let him have thanks. demand of him my condition, and what credit have with the duke. first soldier well, that's set down. reads 'you shall demand of him, whether one captain dumain be i' the camp, a frenchman; what his reputation is with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to corrupt him to revolt.' what say you to this? what do you know of it? beseech you, let me answer to the particular of the inter'gatories: demand them singly. first soldier do you know this captain dumain? know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in paris, from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not say him nay. nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls. first soldier well, is this captain in the duke of florence's camp? upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy. first lord nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your lordship anon. first soldier what is his reputation with the duke? the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' the band: think have his letter in my pocket. first soldier marry, we'll search. in good sadness, do not know; either it is there, or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters in my tent. first soldier here 'tis; here's a paper: shall read it to you? do not know if it be it or no. our interpreter does it well. first lord excellently. first soldier reads 'dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'-- that is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence, one diana, to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very ruttish: pray you, sir, put it up again. first soldier nay, i'll read it first, by your favour. my meaning in't, protest, was very honest in the behalf of the maid; for knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds. damnable both-sides rogue! first soldier reads 'when he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it; after he scores, he never pays the score: half won is match well made; match, and well make it; he ne'er pays after-debts, take it before; and say a soldier, dian, told thee this, men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss: for count of this, the count's a fool, know it, who pays before, but not when he does owe it. thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear, parolles.' he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in's forehead. second lord this is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier. could endure any thing before but a cat, and now he's a cat to me. first soldier perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be fain to hang you. my life, sir, in any case: not that am afraid to die; but that, my offences being many, would repent out the remainder of nature: let me live, sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so may live. first soldier we'll see what may be done, so you confess freely; therefore, once more to this captain dumain: you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour: what is his honesty? he will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus: he professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he is stronger than hercules: he will lie, sir, with such volubility, that you would think truth were a fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they know his conditions and lay him in straw. have but little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has every thing that an honest man should not have; what an honest man should have, he has nothing. first lord begin to love him for this. for this description of thine honesty? pox upon him for me, he's more and more a cat. first soldier what say you to his expertness in war? faith, sir, he has led the drum before the english tragedians; to belie him, will not, and more of his soldiership know not; except, in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of files: would do the man what honour can, but of this am not certain. first lord he hath out-villained villany so far, that the rarity redeems him. pox on him, he's a cat still. first soldier his qualities being at this poor price, need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt. sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the entail from all remainders, and a perpetual succession for it perpetually. first soldier what's his brother, the other captain dumain? second lord why does be ask him of me? first soldier what's he? e'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so great as the first in goodness, but greater a great deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward, yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is: in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming on he has the cramp. first soldier if your life be saved, will you undertake to betray the florentine? ay, and the captain of his horse, count rousillon. first soldier i'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure. aside i'll no more drumming; a plague of all drums! only to seem to deserve well, and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count, have run into this danger. yet who would have suspected an ambush where was taken?

admiringly, my liege, at first stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing, contempt his scornful perspective did lend me, which warp'd the line of every other favour; scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen; extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object: thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself, since have lost, have loved, was in mine eye the dust that did offend it. well excused: that thou didst love her, strikes some scores away from the great compt: but love that comes too late, like a remorseful pardon slowly carried, to the great sender turns a sour offence, crying, 'that's good that's gone.' our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have, not knowing them until we know their grave: oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust, destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what's done, while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon. be this sweet helen's knell, and now forget her. send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin: the main consents are had; and here we'll stay to see our widower's second marriage-day. which better than the first, dear heaven, bless! or, ere they meet, in me, nature, cesse! come on, my son, in whom my house's name must be digested, give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter, that she may quickly come. gives a ring by my old beard, and every hair that's on't, helen, that's dead, was a sweet creature: such a ring as this, the last that e'er took her at court, saw upon her finger. hers it was not. now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye, while was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't. this ring was mine; and, when gave it helen, bade her, if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help, that by this token would relieve her. had you that craft, to reave her of what should stead her most? my gracious sovereign, howe'er it pleases you to take it so, the ring was never hers. son, on my life, have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it at her life's rate. am sure saw her wear it. you are deceived, my lord; she never saw it: in florence was it from a casement thrown me, wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought stood engaged: but when had subscribed to mine own fortune and inform'd her fully could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture, she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again. plutus himself, that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine, hath not in nature's mystery more science than have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas helen's, whoever gave it you. then, if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself, confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement you got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger, unless she gave it to yourself in bed, where you have never come, or sent it us upon her great disaster. she never saw it. thou speak'st it falsely, as love mine honour; and makest conjectural fears to come into me which would fain shut out. if it should prove that thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;-- and yet know not: thou didst hate her deadly, and she is dead; which nothing, but to close her eyes myself, could win me to believe, more than to see this ring. take him away. guards seize my fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall, shall tax my fears of little vanity, having vainly fear'd too little. away with him! we'll sift this matter further. if you shall prove this ring was ever hers, you shall as easy prove that husbanded her bed in florence, where yet she never was. exit, guarded am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings. enter a gentleman gentleman gracious sovereign, whether have been to blame or no, know not: here's a petition from a florentine, who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself. undertook it, vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant, who by this know is here attending: her business looks in her with an importing visage; and she told me, in a sweet verbal brief, it did concern your highness with herself. reads upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead, blush to say it, he won me. now is the count rousillon a widower: his vows are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. he stole from florence, taking no leave, and follow him to his country for justice: grant it me, king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer flourishes, and a poor maid is undone. will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for this: i'll none of him. the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu, to bring forth this discovery. seek these suitors: go speedily and bring again the count. am afeard the life of helen, lady, was foully snatch'd. now, justice on the doers! re-enter guarded wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you, and that you fly them as you swear them lordship, yet you desire to marry. enter widow and what woman's that? am, my lord, a wretched florentine, derived from the ancient capilet: my suit, as do understand, you know, and therefore know how far may be pitied. widow am her mother, sir, whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring, and both shall cease, without your remedy. come hither, count; do you know these women? my lord, neither can nor will deny but that know them: do they charge me further? why do you look so strange upon your wife? she's none of mine, my lord. if you shall marry, you give away this hand, and that is mine; you give away heaven's vows, and those are mine; you give away myself, which is known mine; for by vow am so embodied yours, that she which marries you must marry me, either both or none. your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you are no husband for her. my lord, this is a fond and desperate creature, whom sometime have laugh'd with: let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that would sink it here. sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies. good my lord, ask him upon his oath, if he does think he had not my virginity. what say'st thou to her? she's impudent, my lord, and was a common gamester to the camp. he does me wrong, my lord; if were so, he might have bought me at a common price: do not believe him. behold this ring, whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel; yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o' the camp, if be one. he blushes, and 'tis it: of six preceding ancestors, that gem, conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue, hath it been owed and worn. this is his wife; that ring's a thousand proofs. methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it. did, my lord, but loath am to produce so bad an instrument: his name's parolles. saw the man to-day, if man he be. find him, and bring him hither. exit an attendant what of him? he's quoted for a most perfidious slave, with all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd; whose nature sickens but to speak a truth. am or that or this for what he'll utter, that will speak any thing? she hath that ring of yours. think she has: certain it is liked her, and boarded her i' the wanton way of youth: she knew her distance and did angle for me, madding my eagerness with her restraint, as all impediments in fancy's course are motives of more fancy; and, in fine, her infinite cunning, with her modern grace, subdued me to her rate: she got the ring; and had that which any inferior might at market-price have bought. must be patient: you, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife, may justly diet me. pray you yet; since you lack virtue, will lose a husband; send for your ring, will return it home, and give me mine again. have it not. what ring was yours, pray you? sir, much like the same upon your finger. know you this ring? this ring was his of late. and this was it gave him, being abed. the story then goes false, you threw it him out of a casement. have spoke the truth. enter my lord, do confess the ring was hers. you boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you. is this the man you speak of? ay, my lord. tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, charge you, not fearing the displeasure of your master, which on your just proceeding i'll keep off, by him and by this woman here what know you? so please your majesty, my master hath been an honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him, which gentlemen have. come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman? faith, sir, he did love her; but how? how, pray you? he did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman. how is that? he loved her, sir, and loved her not. as thou art a knave, and no knave. what an equivocal companion is this! am a poor man, and at your majesty's command. he's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator. do you know he promised me marriage? faith, know more than i'll speak. but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest? yes, so please your majesty. did go between them, as said; but more than that, he loved her: for indeed he was mad for her, and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and know not what: yet was in that credit with them at that time that knew of their going to bed, and of other motions, as promising her marriage, and things which would derive me ill will to speak of; therefore will not speak what know. thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say they are married: but thou art too fine in thy evidence; therefore stand aside. this ring, you say, was yours? ay, my good lord. where did you buy it? or who gave it you? it was not given me, nor did not buy it. who lent it you? it was not lent me neither. where did you find it, then? found it not. if it were yours by none of all these ways, how could you give it him? never gave it him. this woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off and on at pleasure. this ring was mine; gave it his first wife. it might be yours or hers, for aught know. take her away; do not like her now; to prison with her: and away with him. unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring, thou diest within this hour. i'll never tell you. take her away. i'll put in bail, my liege. think thee now some common customer. by jove, if ever knew man, 'twas you. wherefore hast thou accused him all this while? because he's guilty, and he is not guilty: he knows am no maid, and he'll swear to't; i'll swear am a maid, and he knows not. great king, am no strumpet, by my life; am either maid, or else this old man's wife. she does abuse our ears: to prison with her. good mother, fetch my bail. stay, royal sir: exit widow the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for, and he shall surety me. but for this lord, who hath abused me, as he knows himself, though yet he never harm'd me, here quit him: he knows himself my bed he hath defiled; and at that time he got his wife with child: dead though she be, she feels her young one kick: so there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick: and now behold the meaning. re-enter widow, with is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes? is't real that see? no, my good lord; 'tis but the shadow of a wife you see, the name and not the thing. both, both. pardon! my good lord, when was like this maid, found you wondrous kind. there is your ring; and, look you, here's your letter; this it says: 'when from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child,' &c. this is done: will you be mine, now you are doubly won? if she, my liege, can make me know this clearly, i'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly. if it appear not plain and prove untrue, deadly divorce step between me and you! my dear mother, do see you living? mine eyes smell onions; shall weep anon: to good tom drum, lend me a handkercher: so, thank thee: wait on me home, i'll make sport with thee: let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones. let us from point to point this story know, to make the even truth in pleasure flow. to if thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower, choose thou thy husband, and i'll pay thy dower; for can guess that by thy honest aid thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid. of that and all the progress, more or less, resolvedly more leisure shall express: all yet seems well; and if it end so meet, the bitter past, more welcome is the sweet. flourish the king's a beggar, now the play is done: all is well ended, if this suit be won, that you express content; which we will pay, with strife to please you, day exceeding day: ours be your patience then, and yours our parts; your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
