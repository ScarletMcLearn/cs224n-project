Wall In this same interlude it doth befall That one Snout by name, present a wall; And such a wall, as would have you think, That had in it a crannied hole or chink, Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby, Did whisper often very secretly. Then, there is another thing: we must have a wall in the great chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did talk through the chink of a wall. Before the time did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me: then, what graces in my love do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
