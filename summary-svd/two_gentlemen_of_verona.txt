What? 'Silvia, this night will enfranchise thee.' 'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose. Eglamour, thou art a gentleman-- Think not flatter, for swear do not-- Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd: Thou art not ignorant what dear good will bear unto the banish'd Valentine, Nor how my father would enforce me marry Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors. Silvia, speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio; For Valentine, need not cite him to it: will send him hither to you presently. Now, by the honour of my ancestry, do applaud thy spirit, Valentine, And think thee worthy of an empress' love: Know then, here forget all former griefs, Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again, Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit, To which thus subscribe: Sir Valentine, Thou art a gentleman and well derived; Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
