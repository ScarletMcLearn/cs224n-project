Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus Master, shall fetch your stuff from shipboard? This purse of ducats received from you, And Dromio, my man, did bring them me. They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer? Signior Antipholus, wonder much That you would put me to this shame and trouble; And, not without some scandal to yourself, With circumstance and oaths so to deny This chain which now you wear so openly: Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment, You have done wrong to this my honest friend, Who, but for staying on our controversy, Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day: This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
