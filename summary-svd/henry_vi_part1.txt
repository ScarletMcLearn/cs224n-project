When Talbot hath set footing once in France And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill, Who then but English Henry will be lord And thou be thrust out like a fugitive? Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house, Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France, Either to get the town again or die: And as sure as English Henry lives And as his father here was conqueror, As sure as in this late-betrayed town Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried, So sure swear to get the town or die. Enter another Messenger Messenger My gracious lords, to add to your laments, Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse, must inform you of a dismal fight Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
