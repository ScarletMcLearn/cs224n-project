Re-enter and Provost For this new-married man approaching here, Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd Your well defended honour, you must pardon For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,-- Being criminal, in double violation Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,-- The very mercy of the law cries out Most audible, even from his proper tongue, 'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!' Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure; Like doth quit like, and still Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested; Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage. Provost So please you, this friar hath been with him, and advised him for the entertainment of death.
