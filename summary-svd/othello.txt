Enter and Tush! Honest Iago, My Desdemona must leave to thee: prithee, let thy wife attend on her: And bring them after in the best advantage. know, Iago, Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio. no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be so determinate as the removing of Cassio. For, sir, It is as sure as you are Roderigo, Were the Moor, would not be Iago: In following him, follow but myself; Heaven is my judge, not for love and duty, But seeming so, for my peculiar end: For when my outward action doth demonstrate The native act and figure of my heart In compliment extern, 'tis not long after But will wear my heart upon my sleeve For daws to peck at: am not what am.
