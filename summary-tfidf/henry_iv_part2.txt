Lord Chief-Justice Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster against the Archbishop and the Earl of Northumberland. Second Drawer Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph hath brought word. As good as heart can wish: The king is almost wounded to the death; And, in the fortune of my lord your son, Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field; And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John, Is prisoner to your son: such a day, So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won, Came not till now to dignify the times, Since Caesar's fortunes!
