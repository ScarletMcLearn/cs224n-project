will forget that Julia is alive, Remembering that my love to her is dead; And Valentine I'll hold an enemy, Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend. Julia lose and Valentine lose: If keep them, needs must lose myself; If lose them, thus find by their loss For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia. Silvia, speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio; For Valentine, need not cite him to it: will send him hither to you presently. Enter and Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit? Now, by the honour of my ancestry, do applaud thy spirit, Valentine, And think thee worthy of an empress' love: Know then, here forget all former griefs, Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again, Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit, To which thus subscribe: Sir Valentine, Thou art a gentleman and well derived; Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
